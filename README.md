for-the-hungry
==============

This repository is for the sharing and improvement of the For the Hungry Facebook app.

It was originally created on behalf of the Hunger Task Force of the Greater Milwaukee Area.

Forks are appreciated; useful too, as this is a basic implementation of the Facebook api

and can serve as a complete project stub

Project Requirements:
PHP 5 (no special features are used in this particular branch at this time, so PHP4 will work)
Class 'A' browser with Javascript enabled
